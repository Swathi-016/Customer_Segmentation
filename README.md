# Customer_Segmentation


## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the process of customer segmentation using clustering techniques. The main objective is to analyze customer data and group customers into distinct segments that can be used for targeted marketing strategies and business decision-making.

The notebook typically covers the following steps:
- Importing and preprocessing the dataset
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data transformation and scaling
- Applying clustering algorithms such as K-Means
- Visualizing customer groups
- Interpreting cluster characteristics to derive insights

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

Install them using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook customersegmentaion.ipynb
```
2. Load the dataset (for example, `Mall_Customers.csv`). Ensure the dataset is placed in the correct directory or update the file path in the notebook.
3. Execute the cells sequentially.
4. Analyze the generated clusters and plots.

## Output
The notebook produces:
- Cluster assignments for customers
- Visual representations of customer groups
- Business insights regarding high-value and low-value customer segments

## Notes
- Update the dataset path before executing the notebook.
- The clustering algorithm can be replaced or extended with alternatives such as Hierarchical Clustering or DBSCAN.
